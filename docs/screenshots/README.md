## Workflow Diagram

To add the workflow diagram:

1. Take a screenshot of your n8n workflow (the one you just showed me)
2. Save it as `workflow-diagram.png` in this directory
3. Recommended dimensions: 1920x1080 or similar for clarity
4. Make sure the workflow is clearly visible with all nodes labeled

The screenshot will automatically appear in the main README.md file.
